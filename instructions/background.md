***Background***

The Midea Heat Pump Hot Water heater is an efficient water heater using heat-pump technology. It comes with an integrated WiFi adapter and associated iOS/Android app, but no easy way of integrating that with Home Assistant.

For the investment of around US$20, you can get full sensor monitoring and control in Home Assistant through the unit's built-in MODBUS protocol and a WiFi-enabled RS485 Serial Server.

There are many such devices, but I have used the Elfin-EW11 for ease-of-use, packaging and price.
