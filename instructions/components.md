***Components***

Purchase an RS485 to WiFi module. There are many available - in board form, as a packaged module, as a DIN unit for mounting on a rail. 

The module I used is the Elfin EW11 RS486 WiFi Serial Server from Hi-Flying.com. http://www.hi-flying.com/elfin-ew10-elfin-ew11

I sourced my unit from Aliexpress, with supporting antenna, connector cables and mounting block: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006252294801.html but this unit is available from many vendors.

To power the EW11, I used an AM11-12W12C 220V AC to 12V DC transformer. It has an output of 1000mW - more than enough to drive the EW11. Again, I sourced this component from Aliexpress, but any number of modules would do the same job: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005937263063.html
